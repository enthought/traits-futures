Complete examples
=================

This section describes three complete examples, that make use of the
three different background task types that Traits Futures currently supports.

Slow squares
------------

This :download:`example script <examples/slow_squares.py>` demonstrates a
simple TraitsUI application that allows several background calculations to be
running simultaneously, and displays the state of all previously submitted
calculations in a table. Each "calculation" is a squaring operation; the
calculation may fail randomly, with an increased chance of failure for larger
inputs.

Prime counting
--------------

This :download:`example script <examples/prime_counting.py>` demonstrates the
:class:`~.ProgressFuture`, which reports progress information back to the
GUI as the background computation progresses.

Approximating Pi
----------------

The final :download:`example <examples/pi_iterations.py>` uses the Chaco 2d
plotting library and shows the use of the :class:`~.IterationFuture`.
Successive approximations to π are computed and plotted, with the plot
updated live with each new value reported by the background task.

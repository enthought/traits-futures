Contexts and multiprocessing
============================

.. note::
   The multiprocessing support in Traits Futures is provisional. The API
   is subject to change in future releases. Feedback on the feature is
   welcome.

By default, the |TraitsExecutor| submits its background tasks to a thread pool.
In some cases, for example in the case of multiple heavily CPU-bound background
tasks, it may be desirable to run the background tasks in separate processes
instead. For this to work, the Traits Futures code needs to know that it has to
work internally with multiprocessing-safe variants of the usual concurrency
primitives: events, queues, worker pools and the like.

This can be achieved through use of a *context*, or more specifically,
an object implementing the |IParallelContext| interface. A context provides
the executor with a way of creating related and compatible
concurrency constructs.

Traits Futures provides two different contexts: the |MultithreadingContext|
and the |MultiprocessingContext|. By default, the executor will use a
|MultithreadingContext|, but you can create and pass in your own context
instead. The context should be closed with the |close| method once it's
no longer needed.

Here's an example ``main`` function that creates an executor that uses
a multiprocessing context::

    def main():
        context = MultiprocessingContext()
        traits_executor = TraitsExecutor(context=context)
        try:
            view = SquaringHelper(traits_executor=traits_executor)
            view.configure_traits()
        finally:
            traits_executor.shutdown()
            context.close()

Here's a :download:`complete TraitsUI example
<examples/background_processes.py>` that makes use of this.

Traits Futures: reactive background processing for Traits and TraitsUI
======================================================================

Release v\ |release|.

The |traits_futures| package provides a means to fire off a background
calculation from a `TraitsUI`_ application, and later respond to the result(s)
of that calculation, leaving the main UI responsive for user interactions while
the background calculation is in progress.


Features
--------

- Supports simple calls, iterations, and progress-reporting functions. Can
  easily be extended to support other messaging patterns.
- Dispatching a background task returns a "future" object, which provides:

  - information about state changes (e.g., background task completion)
  - facilities to (cooperatively) cancel a long-running background task
  - access to result(s) arriving from the background task

- Future objects are |HasTraits| instances, suitable for integration
  into a TraitsUI application.
- No need to be a threading expert! Incoming results arrive as trait changes in
  the main thread. This eliminates a large class of potential issues with
  traditional thread-based solutions (race conditions, deadlocks, and UI
  updates off the main thread).
- Cross-platform.


Limitations
-----------

- By design, and unlike :mod:`concurrent.futures`, |traits_futures| requires the
  UI event loop to be running in order to process results.
- Requires Python 3.6 or later.


Quick start
-----------

Here's a :download:`complete example <guide/examples/quick_start.py>` showing a
minimal TraitsUI application that fires off a background computation when its
"Calculate" button is pressed, and shows the result when it arrives.
